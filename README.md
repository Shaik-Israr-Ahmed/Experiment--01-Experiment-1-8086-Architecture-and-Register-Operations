language programs for register-to-register data transfer, memory
storage, and exchanging two 16-bit memory values.

the main functional units of the 8086 microprocessor. - Describe the
roles of the Bus Interface Unit (BIU) and Execution Unit (EU). - Write
8086 assembly instructions for 16-bit data transfer. - Exchange data
between two memory locations using registers.

## Software Required

-   An 8086 assembly emulator, such as emu8086 or an equivalent
    8086-compatible emulator.
-   A text editor for writing the assembly programs.

## Part (a): 8086 Architecture and Functional Units

### Question

Explain the architecture of the 8086 microprocessor with a neat block
diagram, describing the functions of the BIU and EU.

### Theory

The 8086 microprocessor is a 16-bit microprocessor developed by Intel. It has a 16-bit data bus and a 20-bit address bus, allowing it to access up to 1 MB of memory. The architecture of the 8086 microprocessor is divided into two main units: the Bus Interface Unit (BIU) and the Execution Unit (EU).

The Bus Interface Unit (BIU) is responsible for communication between the microprocessor and memory or input/output devices. It fetches instructions from memory, reads and writes data, generates the 20-bit physical address, and contains the segment registers CS, DS, SS and ES, along with the Instruction Pointer (IP). It also contains a 6-byte instruction queue to store prefetched instructions.

The Execution Unit (EU) is responsible for decoding and executing instructions. It performs arithmetic and logical operations using the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). It contains general-purpose registers AX, BX, CX and DX, pointer and index registers SP, BP, SI and DI, and a flag register that stores the status of operations.

The BIU fetches instructions and stores them in the instruction queue, while the EU takes these instructions, decodes them and executes them. Both units can work in parallel, allowing the BIU to fetch the next instructions while the EU executes the current ones. This improves the overall processing speed and efficiency of the 8086 microprocessor.

### Working Principle

The BIU fetches instruction bytes and stores them in its 6-byte queue
while the EU executes instructions already available in the queue. When
the EU needs memory or I/O access, it requests the BIU to perform the
bus operation. A change in program flow, such as a jump, may cause the
instruction queue to be flushed and refilled.

## Part (b): Transfer a 16-bit Value Between Registers and Store It in Memory

### Question

Write an 8086 assembly language program to transfer a 16-bit data value
from one register to another and store the result in memory.

### Algorithm

1.  Load a 16-bit value into AX.
2.  Transfer the value from AX to BX.
3.  Store the value in BX into the memory variable `RESULT`.
4.  Stop the program.

### Assembly Program

``` asm
.MODEL SMALL
.STACK 100H

.DATA
    RESULT DW 0000H

.CODE
MAIN PROC
    MOV AX, @DATA
    MOV DS, AX

    MOV AX, 1234H       ; Load 16-bit value into AX
    MOV BX, AX          ; Copy AX into BX
    MOV RESULT, BX      ; Store BX in memory

    MOV AH, 4CH
    INT 21H
MAIN ENDP
END MAIN
```

### Expected Result

-   AX = `1234H`
-   BX = `1234H`
-   RESULT = `1234H`

### Explanation

`MOV BX, AX` copies the 16-bit contents of AX into BX without changing
AX. `MOV RESULT, BX` stores the contents of BX in the 16-bit memory
variable `RESULT`. The `MOV` instruction does not modify the source
operand.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Part (c): Exchange Two 16-bit Memory Locations Using Registers

### Question

Write an 8086 assembly language program to exchange the contents of two
16-bit memory locations using registers.

### Algorithm

1.  Load the first memory value into AX.
2.  Load the second memory value into BX.
3.  Store BX at the first memory location.
4.  Store AX at the second memory location.
5.  Stop the program.

### Assembly Program

 

### Expected Result

  Memory Variable     Before Execution   After Execution
  ----------------- ------------------ -----------------
  VALUE1                       `1111H`           `2222H`
  VALUE2                       `2222H`           `1111H`

### Explanation

  
------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Procedure

1.  Open an 8086-compatible assembler or emulator.
2.  Create a new assembly source file.
3.  Enter and assemble the program for the selected part.
4.  Correct any syntax or assembler-specific errors.
5.  Execute the program step by step or run it.
6.  Inspect the registers and memory variables.
7.  Record the observed results and compare them with the expected
    results.
